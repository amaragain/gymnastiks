Wheel gymnastic is basically a form of gymnastics that originated in Germany. Within a few days of its evolution, this form of gymnastic became popular all over and still they have its use in the world of gymnastic. Those who are wheel gymansts, they usually do exercises in a large sized wheel that is basically termed as Rhonrad gymnastics wheel, German wheel and gym wheel. There are basically three core categories of this exercise like spiral, straight line and vault.\r\nThis German wheel was invented in the year 1925 by Otto Feick in Sch√∂nau a der Brend. Being the son of a blacksmith, Feick was highly inspired by the memory of an event from his childhood days that he spent in Reichenbach, when he had tied sticks between the two cartwheel bands that his father had made and rolled down a hill.\r\n</p>\r\n <p>\r\nHe was basically a lock smith and also railway men. It was from the year 1914 to 1923 that he was related with the work of establishment of Deutsche Reichsbann. At that time he was the supporter of the trade union movement and also he was the member of the board of the union of German Railway workers. He was imprisoned for his activities in the defense against the secession efforts of the Palatinate the actual motto of his life was fights, rings-but sing.\r\n</p>\r\n <p>\r\nHe was the one who was filed for a patent as wheel gymnastic as well as sports equipment. He had invented the wheel in the great Ludwigshafen am Rhein ca in the year 1920-22. This happened on the grounds of VSK Germania, a popular sports club and he was the founding chairman of that club. Th patent was issued in the year 1925 on 8th November. The name and the term Rhonrad has been protected as well as registered since 1926.\r\n</p>\r\n <p>\r\nIt was in the year 1936 that this sport was shown at the great Olympic Games that was held in Berlin. But this gymnast was not presented as an Olympic discipline. The actual focus of the wheel gymnasts remains largely in Germany. These wheels are of great use and the gymnasts prefer performing several types of acts using this particular wheel. The best part of this wheel is that these wheels are extremely lightweight. These wheels are lightweight so that the gymnasts can use them freely without having any issue. As this particular wheel was invented in Germany the wheel is termed as German wheel.\r\n</p>\r\n <p>\r\nThere are basically three disciplines in which the wheels are used.The first and foremost is the straight line. Here, the wheels rolls over an area covering 23 to 3 meters on both the tires and this will be compulsory as well as voluntary routines pre gymnastics. Some of the elements that like the stretching or gymnastics bars are used. Then there comes the spiral gymnastics where the wheel moves on one of the tires. The next is the Jump, which is performed by male.\r\n                            </p>', 'How-German-Wheels-became-popular-as-Gymnastic-wheels?', 15, '', 'active', 'Gymnastics, Training, Bengaluru, Bangalore, Marathahalli, Excercise, Fitness, Kids, Recreation, Dance, Artistic, Children, Games, Activity, Health, White Field, Kundalahalli', '2021-07-25'),
